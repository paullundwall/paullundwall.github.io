title:  "Why learn Ancient Greek?"

Ancient Greek is not spoken anymore nor taught as much in schools. Every great literary work written in it has been translated through and through, in almost every language, by many esteemed classicists. Most of all, Ancient Greek is extremely complex, with all those dialects, rules, exceptions, and ghastly irregular verbs... Why dedicate many hours of your life to learning this dead language?

The main reasons I was given by fellow students from my school who were trying to recruit new classicists were the following:

- It helps us understand our language (French) better
- It helps us memorise the names of terms and concepts in a variety of subjects, namely Biology, Physics, Philosophy
- It helps us develop our rational mind

While they are all true to some extent, these reasons were extremely vague and unappealing. This sort of missionary work is rarely successful, like trying to convince a young person to stop smoking by telling them that they will die otherwise. It is simply too abstract, so it enters one ear and exits the other.

Besides, Latin can do all of the above, and we had to do one year of Latin before choosing to study any Ancient Greek at all. Why start all over again?

The appeal I found in Greek early on was simply in the alphabet. It gave the language a rather cryptic aspect, different from latin, more mysterious... In short, it was exciting to learn how to decypher the letters, and then the sentences. I was drawn to it by the alphabet, but stayed for the language.

There is also an undeniable thrill about a challenge. The missionaries were very careful not to mention how difficult Greek was as a subject, as they did not want to scare us off, and that is a mistake. The subject of Ancient Greek should be presented like one of a happy few who shed sweat together just to solve a little puzzle. Even the French Mathematician Cédric Villani, who was awarded the Fields medal in 2010, stated that the only real subjects that were really intellectually challenging for him were Latin and Greek. Nothing raises more interest than a code difficult to crack.

There were naturally other reasons for learning the language, such as the fact that the Greek civilisation was undeniably one of the most flourishing and revolutionary ones in Ancient History, being the pioneer of many sciences for centuries, whether it be Philosophy, Medicine, Astronomy, Mathematics, History... Its role in the arts, especially poetry, is undeniable. Even during the Roman Hegemony, Greek was spoken and written by the Roman nobility, and many Roman artistic themes were thoroughly copied from the Greek world. The window to this culture is, of course, its language, which truly defines it. Nowhere else, not even on the Acropolis, will you ever feel closer to the Ancient Greek civilisation than when reading texts written in its language. Many learned men from the Renaissance to the 20th century did exactly that, and were profoundly influenced by the language and, consequently, the culture of the Greeks.

Were some teachers given the time to describe the essential role that Ancient Greeks texts played in the works of the greatest philosophers, poets, playwrights, and men of power of our modern and contemporary era who had (and usually taken much pleasure in doing so) studied classical texts in their original form, I am convinced that many more students, otherwise more interested in and more familiar with these recent thinkers and artists, would have flocked to the Language department to sign in for some Greek lessons.

One could say that the genius of Pierre de Ronsard, Thomas Hobbes, G.W.F. Hegel,  Martin Heidegger, Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, Friedrich Nietzche, and Oscar Wilde would not have flourished were it not for their study of this language, as well as Latin.

Jean Racine's poetic abilities and knowledge of classical drama could not have been possible were it not for his rigorous jansenist education that introduced him to the world of Ancient Greek tragedy.

A lot of what these great men wrote about can be traced back to Greek concepts, or words, or themes... If Bernard de Chartres was referencing anything when talking about the giants' shoulders on which he was standing, it would have been the Greeks. 

François Rabelais writes in his _Pantagruel_ that it is shameful for someone to call himself a "learned person" if he does not have any knowledge of Greek, which is admittedly a very radical stance by today's standards, but not too outlandish for 16th century France. 

The important role that Ancient Greek played in schools, notably in France, has greatly shrunk ever since the 1970s, its students only benefitting from three hours every week instead of five, and starting a year or even two years later than what was the norm. I have heard many teachers argue that the reason for this was that most people only saw the side-benefits from studying Greek, like its usefulness for learning technical terms in other subjects, which is certainly interesting, but not enough of a reason to study the grammar, syntax rules, irregular verb forms etc.

Many fail to see the core interest in learning Greek, which is that it makes you think, and this thinking is just you following the footsteps of the Greats from the last centuries. You are, like them, reading the texts, translating the texts, and imitating the texts. You cannot equal their genius, but you can at least brush up on your Greek.
