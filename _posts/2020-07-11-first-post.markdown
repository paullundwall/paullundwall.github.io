Ancient Greek is not spoken anymore nor taught as much in schools. Every great literary work written in it has been translated through and through, in almost every language, by many esteemed classicists. Most of all, Ancient Greek is extremely complex, with all those dialects, rules, exceptions, and ghastly irregular verbs... Why dedicate many hours of your life to learning this dead language?

The main reasons I was given by teachers and students from my school were the following:

- It helps us understand our language (French) better
- It helps us memorise the names of terms and concepts in a variety of subjects, namely Biology, French and Philosophy
- It helps us develop our rational mind

While they are all true to some extent, these reasons were the most vague and unappealing ones that I had yet heard.

Besides, Latin can do all of the above, and we had to do one year of Latin before choosing to do any Ancient Greek at all. Why start all over again?

Had some teachers taken the time to describe the essential role that Ancient Greek texts played in the works of the greatest philosophers, poets, playwrights, and men of power of our modern era who had (and usually taken much pleasure in doing so) studied Ancient Greek, I am convinced that many more students, otherwise more interested in and more familiar with these more recent thinkers and artists, would have flocked to the Language department to sign in for some Greek lessons.

One could say that the genius of Thomas Hobbes, G.W.F. Hegel,  Martin Heidegger, Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, François Rabelais, would not have flourished were it not for their study of this language, as well as Latin.

Jean Racine's poetic abilities and knowledge of classical drama could not have been possible were it not for his rigorous jansenist education that introduced him to the world of Ancient Greek tragedy.

Oscar Wilde himself said that Classics was the only course of study at Oxford where one can be "simultaneously brilliant and unreasonable".

French Mathematician Cédric Villani recently claimed that the only subjects that would really challenge his brain at school were the studies of ancient languages.

In short, studying classics makes you think, and makes you smarter, and the byproducts of it

While studying Ancient Greek texts and their contents is indispensable, taking the time to translate the texts into another language presents another challenge altogether.
