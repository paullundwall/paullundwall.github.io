title:  "The music in French, English, and Greek poetry"
---

We have had a few passages from the Homeric epics as well as some from ancient tragedies to translate in Greek class, but there are unfortunately just so many lessons of Greek we can have, so we did not have the time to tackle the subject of metre, recitation, and the general music of Greek poetry, as we barely had time to translate the passages at all. I decided to learn about it on my own, and I will be attempting to compare it to English and French poetry, with which I am more familiar.
