title:  "The music of French, English, and Greek poetry"
---

We have had a few passages from the Homeric epics as well as some from ancient tragedies to translate in Greek class, but we did not have the time to tackle the subject of metre, recitation, and the general music of Greek poetry. I decided to learn about it on my own, and I will be attempting to compare it to English and French poetry, with which I am more familiar.

Poetry is an art of creation, and is founded on language. The poet's work is to effectively uses the language and its specific characteristics to give an impression, convey an emotion, etc. Therefore he needs to make use of the language's musicality. French, English, and Ancient Greek differ immensely in terms of music.

French has what we call a rhythmical metre, meaning that the length of a poetic line is determined simply by the number of syllables in it. Typically, they are 8, 10, or 12 syllables long. That is a very unsophisticated and not very musical way to use rythm, so French poetry makes up for it with rhyme. French poetry has a whole system of poor, sufficient, and rich rhymes.

A poor rhyme would be when both rhyming words only have one common sound, like bee and tree.
A rhyme is sufficient when both words have two common sounds, like tree and free.
A rhyme is rich when both words have three or more common sounds, like despair and prepare.
The general rule is that one should avoid using poor rhymes and be consistent with the chosen rhyme style, whether it be sufficient or rich.

A French poet would also needs to alternate between masculine and feminine rhymes. A feminine rhyme is one that contains a silent e like "femme" and "flamme", and a masculine one is one that does not, like "grand" and "prend".

In English, the metre is called qualitative. The length of a line is not determined by the number of syllables, but by the number of feet, each containing a number of syllables, stressed or unstressed. English is a language that naturally arranges itself into iambs. for instance the iambic pentameter:

```
hello my dude
