There is no doubt that the Greeks liked to drink, and one has to look no further than in their songs and poems. In fact, some of the earliest written musical compositions in history we have found are Greek drinking songs. Here are some examples, along with my translation attempts:

```

Ἡ γῆ μέλαινα πίνει,
πίνει δένδρεα δ'αὖ γῆν
πίνει θάλασσ' ἀναύρους,
ὁ δ'ἥλιος θάλασσαν,
τὸν δ'ἥλιον σελήνη·
τί μοι μάχεσθ', ἑταῖροι,
καὐτῷ θέλοντι πίνειν ;



The black earth drinks,
and the trees in turn from the earth
and the sea drinks from the Thessalian river,
and the sun drinks from the sea
and the moon drinks from the sun.
why do you wish to fight with me, comrades,
and also wish to fight with me?

```
